# amazon-sales-forecasting
Amazon Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning. This project analyzes sales data, applies models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA, and Prophet, and evaluates them using R² and RMSE to compare forecasting performance.
Here is a detailed README template for your Amazon Sales Forecasting project that clearly explains the work done, tools used, goals, and future possibilities so anyone can understand the project:



## Overview  
This project analyzes Amazon sales data and builds machine learning models to forecast future sales. The goal is to provide accurate sales predictions that help improve inventory management, marketing, and strategic decision-making.

## Work Done  
- Collected and preprocessed historical sales data including cleaning and feature engineering.  
- Applied several forecasting models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA (time-series), and Facebook Prophet.  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as R² (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean squared error).  
- Compared model performances to select the best algorithms for sales forecasting in different scenarios.

## Tools and Technologies  
- Python with pandas, numpy for data manipulation  
- scikit-learn for regression and Random Forest models  
- statsmodels for ARIMA time series modeling  
- Prophet for advanced time series forecasting  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## Project Goals  
- Understand the sales trends and seasonality in the Amazon dataset  
- Develop accurate forecast models for short and medium term sales predictions  
- Provide insights to optimize stock levels and marketing campaigns

## What You Can Achieve  
- Deploy the best performing forecasting models to make sales predictions  
- Analyze feature importance and seasonal trends in sales  
- Extend models to other product categories or market segments  
- Use forecasting outputs in business intelligence dashboards

## Future Work  
- Integrate real-time data feeds for live sales forecasting  
- Apply deep learning methods like LSTM or Transformer models for sequence prediction  
- Incorporate external factors like promotions, holidays, and competitor actions for enriched forecasts  
- Automate model retraining and selection to maintain accuracy over time
